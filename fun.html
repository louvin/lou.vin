    <h3> Reading Phillies </h3>
    <p>
     The Reading Phillies are the AA affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. The games are family-friendly and are paired

     for more information, and download the schedule <a href="http://www.milb.com/documents/0/9/0/311369090/2020_schedule_flyer_10.31.19_Home_Away_Games.pdf">here</a>

    <h3> The Pagoda </h3>
    <p>
     Built in 1906 near the top of Mt. Penn, The Pagoda offers a panoramic view of the city of Reading. The Pagoda was 
     originally built as a luxury hotel (but was then sold to the City of Reading for $1 after failing to secure a liquor
     license). Easy to fit in if you have only a bit of spare time in the Reading area as most visit The Pagoda for the view.
     Check out the PagodaCam and opening hours at <a href="http://readingpagoda.com/home.html">The Pagoda's website</a> (note
     that the opening hours only apply to actually entering the building; you can go look anytime).
